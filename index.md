To start using the Gesture Hardware Controller, visit the link above to download the latest version. Follow the instructions below to easily set it up on your computer and begin controlling devices with gestures.

## 🛠 Overview
The Gesture Hardware Controller allows you to control physical devices, such as LED lights and motors, using your hands. This project combines computer vision with embedded electronics to create a touchless interaction system. You can control devices without physical contact, making it ideal for various applications like robotics and interactive installations.

### How It Works
1. **Hand Tracking:** The system uses MediaPipe to track your hand movements in real-time.
2. **Gesture Recognition:** The software in Python recognizes what gestures you make.
3. **Serial Communication:** It communicates with Arduino hardware to control devices.
4. **Device Control:** Use gestures to control motors and lights with ease.

## 🎯 Features
- **Real-Time Hand Tracking:** Detects single or dual hands for flexible control.
- **Gesture-Based Control Modes:** Switch between different gestures for various controls.
- **Stepper Motor Control:** Adjust the position and speed of your motors with hand movements.
- **LED Control:** Toggle LED lights on and off or adjust brightness using hand gestures.
- **Gesture Smoothing:** Ensures fluid motion response through hysteresis and smoothing techniques.
- **Modular Architecture:** Easily extend the system for more features or integrations.

## 📦 System Requirements
To ensure the best experience, please make sure your system meets the following requirements:
- **Operating System:** Windows, MacOS, or Linux.
- **Processor:** Dual-core processor or higher.
- **RAM:** At least 4 GB.
- **Camera:** Standard webcam capable of detecting hand movements.
- **Arduino Board:** Required for hardware control (such as Arduino Uno).
